# **Instant chan**

### **Add to your server**

First you need the bot on your server:

Invite the bot with [this url](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=717139997186326609&permissions=16778256&scope=bot)

> You doesn't need to add some extra permissions.

### **Bind a vocal channel**

1) To transform one vocal channel to a "channel duplicator", you must have his ID (eg. 719539555653346610).

> Check this [guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) to find the vocal channel ID

2) Provide this ID to `instant-chan` by command:
```bash
!instant bind 719539555653346610 # Replace by your channel ID
```

> User must have "Manage channel" permission to achieve this command

3) You're done ! Now your channel must have `... (new)` suffix. Users can create their own channels duplicas.
